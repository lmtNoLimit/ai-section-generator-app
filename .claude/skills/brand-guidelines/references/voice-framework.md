# Brand Voice Framework

## Voice vs. Tone

**Voice** = Brand's personality (consistent)
**Tone** = How voice adapts to context (variable)

Example: A friendly brand (voice) might be celebratory in a win announcement but empathetic in a support response (tone).

- Confident, not arrogant

- Innovative, not gimmicky
- Authentic, not casual

### Step 2: Create Voice Chart

### Step 3: Context Adaptation

| Context | Tone Shift | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Social media | More casual | "Hey there!" |
| Support | More empathetic | "We understand..." |
| Legal | More formal | "In accordance with..." |
| Sales | More confident | "You'll see results..." |

## Voice Testing

Ask these questions:
1. Does this sound like our brand?
2. Would a competitor say this?
3. Does it resonate with our audience?
4. Is it consistent with our values?
